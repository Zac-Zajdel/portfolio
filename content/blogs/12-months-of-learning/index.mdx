title: The 12 Months of Learning Challenge
---

In 2024, I came to a stark realization: I wasn’t challenging myself enough to learn new technologies.

At work, I primarily use Nuxt.js and Laravel, and for personal projects, I often rely on Next.js deployed on Vercel.
But is that all I want to learn until the next gig comes along?
This routine began feeling stagnant, and with AI advancing at an alarming pace, am I making myself easily replaceable?
That wake-up call sparked something within me. I knew I needed to do more.

Watching tech Youtubers like [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) or [The Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen)
showcase the latest and greatest tools was inspiring, but inspiration without action is meaningless.
It was time to go beyond passive learning and start putting my hands on the keyboard.

So with that realization, I’m embarking on a journey I’m calling 12 Months of Learning.
Over the course of 2025, I will dedicate each month to learning a new language or framework while building a simple app.

My goals are as follows:

1. **Expand my skillset**: Familiarize myself with new languages and frameworks.
2. **Master core concepts**: Develop a deeper understanding of common software design patterns.
3. **Share my journey**: Document my progress and lessons learned to help others.

It’s time to step outside my comfort zone, level up my skills, and explore more of the software development world.
I hope you’ll follow along as I tackle this challenge one month at a time!
