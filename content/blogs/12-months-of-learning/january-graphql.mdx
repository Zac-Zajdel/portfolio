## What is GraphQL?

> [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
> It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API,
> gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
> makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Sounds amazing right? The client asking for specific content and only getting that?
As someone who has worked with clients while building a REST API, this is a constant struggle.
An endpoint that has all the data one customer needs might not work for another.
This problem is completely avoidable using GraphQL as long as your schema supports it!
Over the next couple sections, I will dive into how I learned the basics, the pros, the cons, and my overall thoughts.

## The Good üòç

- A Strongly Typed Schema.
- Flexible data fetching for the client.
- Removes the need for API versioning.
- Excellent Dev tooling and documentation.

---

## The Bad üò≠

- Complexity overload.
- N+1 Queries are very easy to introduce.
- Query depth and complexity are items you must protect against.
- A client can ask for too much information that leads to poor performance.
