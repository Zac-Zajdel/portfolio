## What is Dependabot?

[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) is an automation tool to simplify dependency management. With minimal setup,
Dependabot will identify packages in your repository that have available updates and automatically create pull requests on your behalf.

## How to Integrate Dependabot into Your Project

1. Create a `.github` folder in your root directory.
2. Inside that folder add a `dependabot.yml` file and add the following content:

```js title=".github/dependabot.yml" copy
version: 2,
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "wednesday"
    assignees:
      - "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
```

3. Go into your Github projects `Settings` tab.
4. Click on `Code security and analysis` and enable `Dependabot security updates`.
5. Congrats! You now have Dependabot integrated into your project.
