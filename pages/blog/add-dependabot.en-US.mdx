# What is Dependabot?

[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) is an automated tool that is extremely easy to integrate into any project. With the correct configurations,
Dependabot will analyze all dependencies present in your project and search for outdated packages.

This is crucial so your project can use the latest and greatest as well as fix any major security risks found in said packages.
So let's start implementing!

## How to integrate into your project

1. Create a `.github` folder in your root directory.
2. Inside that folder add a `dependabot.yml` file.
3. Add the following content:

```jsx
version: 2,
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "wednesday"
    assignees:
      - "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
```

4. Go into your Github projects `Settings` tab.
5. Click on `Code security and analysis` and enable `Dependabot security updates`.
6. Congrats! You now have Dependabot integrated into your project.
