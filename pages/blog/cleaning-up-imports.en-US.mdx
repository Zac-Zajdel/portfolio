# Clean up imports

We can all agree when importing a file in some nested directory and configuring a import such as `../../../sidebar.tsx` is not clear which directory it is coming from.

This is something most junior developers do not know how to overcome with a cleaner syntax.
Depending if your project uses TypeScript or not, you can create a file in the root directory of your project called `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`.

## What are these config files?

- A `tsconfig` or `jsconfig` json file should live within your projects root directory.
- They help adjust settings related to how we want the compiler to understand the architecture our projects
- A further explanation on these files and their purpose can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html#:~:text=The%20tsconfig.json%20file%20specifies,compiler%20flags%20enabled%20by%20default.)


## Implement in your own project

Generate a `tsconfig.json` file in your root directory and add the following configuration to the paths key:
```json
 "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/components/*": [
        "components/*"
      ]
    }
  },
```
This tells your compiler that any imports starting with `'@/components'` is pointed toward the `components` directory in your app!

## Example

We can take our following example above: `../../../card.tsx`

Let's transform it with our new path: `@/components/global/nav/sidebar.tsx`

^ The transformed example is extremely clear where it is lives and provides a better DX.
