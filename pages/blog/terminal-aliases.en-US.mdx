# Terminal Aliases

Terminal aliases give you the ability to create keyboard shortcuts for common commands.
This will save you time by not writing out the entire command multiple times a day.
Below we will go through how to add aliases for your terminal to recognize and some nice ones
you will immediately find value in.

### The following steps will have you up and running in minutes:

1. Determine which terminal you are using. This can differ between bash/zsh/etc.. For this example
   we will be using zsh.
2. Open your `.zshrc` file using the following command: `nano ~/.zshrc`
3. Once you have opened up Nano, copy the following command into the editor:

```bash
alias c='clear'
```

4. Save your changes, close Nano, and end your terminals instance.
5. Go back into your terminal and type `ls` to get your directories structure.
6. Type `c` and you can now see your alias working as expected. Pretty cool right?

Now you can go out and apply this specifically for your routine command line arguments!
Below is a quick list of some that I use on the daily. Hope this helps :)

```bash
# Quickly generate commit message
alias commit='git commit -m'

# Start up your calculator
alias calc="bc -l"

# Laravel Framework - create process with artisan
alias ar="php artisan"
```
