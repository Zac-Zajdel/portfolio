          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
          My name is Zac Zajdel, and I&apos;m a web developer with over five
          years of experience. Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Steeler
          Nation for life ðŸ–¤ðŸ’›), I now call Dallas, Texas, home. When I&apos;m
          not coding, you&apos;ll find me watching movies, vibing to music, or
          spending time with friends.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a self-proclaimed nerd, I love learning new things. Check out my
          blog where I am learning a new technology every month and talking
          about those experiences here! This industry never lets us get bored or
          complacent, and that&apos;s what makes it so invigorating. The
          commitment and generosity of developers worldwide inspire me todo the
          same.
          <br />
          <br />I started this blog with the hope of sharing what I have learned
          with others. It&apos;s my way of giving back to the community that has
          given me so much. If you&apos;ve made it this far, let&apos;s connect
          :)
