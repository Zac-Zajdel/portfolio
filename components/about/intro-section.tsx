          Hey ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
          I&apos;m Zac, based in Dallas, Texas, honing my craft in web
          development. Between tackling side projects, you&apos;ll catch me
          enjoying movies, constantly tuned into music, and hanging out with
          friends.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the tech realm, I&apos;m a big fan for React, Vue, Laravel, and a
          bunch of other technologies that redefine how developers bring their
          ideas to life. This industry never lets us get bored or complacent,
          and that&apos;s what makes it so invigorating. The commitment and
          generosity of developers worldwide inspire me to strive for
          excellence.
          <br />
          <br />I started this blog with the hope of sharing my discoveries with
          others. It&apos;s my way of giving back to the community that has
          given me so much. If you&apos;ve made it this far, let&apos;s connect
          :)
